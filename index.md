# The Haunter of the Dark

This site explains the Monster in the Dark as a Hunting Horror, also known as the Haunter of the Dark, printed in d20 Call of Cthulhu, pg. 173.  It aims to be a resource for readers after the reveal.

## Why Did Rich Pick The Hunting Horror?

Thematic match.

In its own setting, the Hunting Horror serves evil sorcerers, lurking in shadow until summoned to fetch or kill. That role overlaps closely with the Monster in the Dark’s stated purpose: To lurk in darkness until ordered to kill the main characters.

Both creatures have yellow eyes.  The Haunter of the Dark's are described as burning, and the Monster in the Dark's are visible even in darkness.

## Why Did Rich Stick With the Hunting Horror?

Story opportunities.

The Snarl, a god-eating horror, more real than the gods themselves, shares thematic ground with the eldritch horrors of Call of Cthulhu. Rich may have introduced the Snarl to take the narrative place of Nyarlathotep, the eldritch horror associated with the Hunting Horror, preserving that connection without importing unwanted elements.

Call of Cthulhu rules emphasize sharper divides between PC races and monsters than traditional D&D, and that contrast may have helped inspire Rich’s decision to center the story around the same theme after choosing the Monster in the Dark.

Call of Cthulhu does not put alignments in their monster descriptions.  This may have inspired Rich’s decision to place the Monster in the Dark in a morally ambiguous role: accepting evil around it, yet inclined toward good behavior.
