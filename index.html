        <h2>Ladies and gentlemen, gather round!</h2>
        <p><strong>The unthinkable has finally happened: <em>The Monster in the Dark is a Hunting Horror!</em></strong></p>

        <p>I know this revelation has rattled your sanity, but fear not! Together, we’ll untangle the eldritch threads and make peace with the cosmic horrors of canon.</p>

        <h3>Why the Hunting Horror?</h3>
        <p>The Hunting Horror, also known as the Haunter of the Dark, is a perfect match for the Monster in the Dark. In its traditional lore, the Hunting Horror obeys evil sorcerers, lurking in shadows until called to fetch or kill. This fits the Monster’s role early in the comic—an obedient force confined to darkness—except for the added parody of its humorous complaints about its situation.</p>

        <h3>The Snarl Connection</h3>
        <p>Hunting Horrors serve Nyarlathotep, a link that would have damaged the story’s narrative independence. But what if Rich intentionally created the Snarl—a god-eating horror—as a substitute for Nyarlathotep? This substitution allows the Hunting Horror’s mythos to integrate into <em>The Order of the Stick</em>. It deepens the Snarl’s significance and makes the Monster in the Dark an essential part of the story.</p>

        <h3>Visual and Thematic Match</h3>
        <p>The Hunting Horror’s visual characteristics align closely with the Monster in the Dark. Both creatures are in the dark, something not every candidate achieved, and the Monster’s yellow eyes, visible even in shadow, evoke the Hunting Horror’s burning yellow ones. While standard Hunting Horrors are described with three-lobed eyes, variants with two eyes exist, so the connection to the Hunting Horror is not broken.</p>

        <p>The Monster in the Dark began as an obedient monster lurking in darkness until commanded to kill. However, its comedic misunderstanding of its role—focusing on release from darkness instead of obedience—parodies the archetypal shadowy enforcer, which the Hunting Horror embodies.</p>

        <p>Rich evolves this parody from general shadowy enforcers to the Hunting Horror specifically by turning the horror of the incomprehensible into humorous misunderstandings and interactions. This aligns the Monster in the Dark’s traits with the Hunting Horror’s archetype, continues the Monster in the Dark's pre-existing tendency for misunderstanding, and preserves the story's comedic tone.</p>
