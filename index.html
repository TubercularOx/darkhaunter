        <h2>Origins and Implications</h2>
        <p>The Hunting Horror, also known as the Haunter of the Dark, lives to obey the orders of evil sorcerers. It lurks in the dark and emerges to fetch or kill as commanded. This is the Monster in the Dark as it existed before Strip 100, minus the playful twist of the Monster humorously resenting its shadowy confinement.</p>
        <p>Hunting Horrors are also a species created to serve Nyarlathotep, a potentially frustrating connection for Rich to address. What if Rich leaned into this difficulty? What if the Snarl, the god-killing abomination—a horror more real than the gods themselves—was conceived as a substitute for Nyarlathotep? This would preserve Rich’s creative independence while simultaneously inspiring him to envision an entire world wherein his new ideas could fit. Choosing the Hunting Horror makes the Monster in the Dark an inseparable part of the story.</p>
