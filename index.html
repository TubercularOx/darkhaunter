        <h1>The Haunter of the Dark as the Monster in the Dark</h1>

        <h2>Origins and Implications</h2>
        <p>The Hunting Horror, also known as the Haunter of the Dark, lives to obey the orders of evil sorcerers. It lurks in the dark and emerges to fetch or kill as commanded. This is the Monster in the Dark as it existed before Strip 100, minus the playful twist of the Monster humorously resenting its shadowy confinement.</p>
        <p>Hunting Horrors are also a species created to serve Nyarlathotep, a potentially frustrating connection for Rich to address. What if Rich leaned into this difficulty? By framing the Snarl—a god-killing abomination, a horror more real than the gods themselves—as a substitute for Nyarlathotep, Rich preserves his creative independence while weaving the Hunting Horror’s mythos into the story. This theory not only deepens the Snarl’s significance but also makes the Monster in the Dark an inseparable part of the story.</p>
        <p>The Hunting Horror is immediately apparent as a visual match with the Monster in the Dark. Both creatures are in the dark, and the Monster’s yellow eyes, visible even in shadow, evoke the Hunting Horror’s burning yellow ones. While the standard Hunting Horror is described with a three-lobed eye, the description includes two-eyed forms, making it a plausible match.</p>
        <p>Beyond appearance, their roles align closely. The Monster in the Dark began as an obedient monster lurking in darkness until commanded to kill. However, its comedic misunderstanding of its role—focusing on release from darkness instead of obedience—parodies the archetypal shadowy enforcer, which the Hunting Horror embodies.</p>
        <p>Rich evolves this parody from general shadowy enforcers to the Hunting Horror specifically by turning the horror of the incomprehensible into humorous misunderstandings and interactions.  This aligns the Monster in the Dark’s traits with the Hunting Horror’s archetype, continues the Monster in the Dark's pre-existing tendency for misunderstanding, and preserves the story's comedic tone.</p>
