        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Few who see a hunting horror ever live to report it. Those who have describe it as an enormous black ropy worm or serpent, rather like a legless dragon seen in a nightmare, with a single wing rising from the middle of the back and a long sinuous tail trailing behind. A great gaping maw filled with jagged, irregular teeth gapes open hungrily as it flies in search of prey. It does not move in a direct line, but flies in strange, spiraling, non-Euclidean paths, coiling its way across the sky at a great speed. The creatures are mutable, as some have reported them with two wings instead of one, or two eyes instead of a single three-lobed yellow eye. Occasionally they take the form of a vast formless cloud of pitch-black smoke. In all cases, their presence is accompanied by an unutterably foul odor or stench.</p>
        <p>Hunting horrors haunt the dark places of the universe, from which they are called up at the whim of their lord Nyarlathotep to hunt down any who have offended him. Some maintain that they are actually made of incarnate darkness. Nyarlathotep sometimes takes the form of an enormous hunting horror; this avatar is known as "The Haunter of the Dark."</p>
        <p>Hunting horrors rarely speak, although they utter great harsh cries when on the hunt. They understand instructions given them in any language and can empathetically project emotions at will.</p>

        <h2>Abilities and Traits</h2>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b> Hunting horrors exist to seek out prey and are compelled to either destroy their victims utterly or fetch them back to their dark master. As creatures of darkness, they are vulnerable to light. Moonlight (or torchlight) deals 1d6 points of damage per round, while daylight (or the magical or mechanical equivalent) causes 3d6 points of damage per round. All light-based spells automatically deal full damage on a hunting horror if it fails its save (and half that if it succeeds). Naturally, it will do its utmost to quench all such light sources as soon as possible.</p>
        <p><b>Improved Grab/Ravenous Maw (Ex):</b> If the hunting horror succeeds with its bite attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without allowing its opponent a free attack. The hunting horror then uses its mouth to hold the opponent. Assuming the victim doesn't break free, the hunting horror can choose to either masticate its victim or swallow it whole (see below); the latter option requires another successful grapple check.</p>
        <p><b>Masticate (Ex):</b> After a successful improved grab, the target is held in the hunting horror's jaws, where great jagged teeth gnash it for an automatic 5d8+12 points of damage per round. A character slain in this manner is shredded and dismembered—a definite candidate for a closed-casket funeral.</p>
        <p><b>Improved Grab/Tail-Tentacle:</b> Any character a hunting horror grabs with its tail-tentacle is immediately subjected to an opposed grapple check; this is a free action that does not allow the character a free attack. If the horror is successful, it holds the subject pinned (a pinned opponent loses its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class). If the horror has been compelled to fetch a victim to its dark master, it uses this special attack to immobilize its victim before bearing it away. If it has been commanded to destroy, it can hold a victim helpless with its tail while making additional bite attacks. If the victim is particularly bothersome, the hunting horror can constrict anyone held in its tail-tentacle for 2d6+12 points of damage per round.</p>
        <p><b>Swallow Whole (Ex):</b> Swallowed victims are sucked into the hunting horror's abyssal interior. The victim's movement is restricted to a crawl (one-sixth normal) and it is also exposed to the effects of nausea (see below). The only means of escape is back out the way it came, through the gullet. Should the horror choose, it can vomit out a swallowed victim, projecting it at a great speed toward another object or character (ranged attack, +22, damage 1d6 per 10 feet traveled).</p>
        <p><b>Roar (Ex):</b> If it chooses, the hunting horror can utter a great roar. This is a sonic attack usable once every 1d4 rounds that takes the form of a cone 50 feet long (and high, and wide). The cone deals 10d10 points of sonic damage to all in its path (Will save, DC 24, for half damage).</p>
        <p><b>Nausea (Ex):</b> The area for 200 feet around a hunting horror is suffused with an overwhelming stench, as from some forgotten pit of rottenness. Everyone in or entering this area must make a Fortitude save (DC 15). Those who succeed are queasy, suffering -2 penalties to all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. Those who fail can only take one move action each round because they are nauseated. Creatures with no sense of smell are immune to this attack.</p>
        <p><b>Smoke Form (Su):</b> Using an attack action, a hunting horror can change to an incorporeal form resembling smoke. This increases its speed to 300 feet (good maneuverability).</p>
        <p><b>Penetrate Deflection (Ex):</b> A hunting horror's attacks ignore the effects of deflection bonuses (subtract any deflection bonus from its target's Armor Class).</p>
        <p><b>Immunities:</b> The creature is immune to paralysis effects.</p>
        <p><b>Spell-like Abilities:</b> As servitors of Nyarlathotep, master of magic, all hunting horrors know the following spells, of which they can use one per round—darkness, death by flames, deflect harm, evil eye, fist of Yog-Sothoth, grasp of Cthulhu, shriveling, suggestion, true strike, and wrack.</p>
