# A Curious Volume of Forgotten Lore

The Hunting Horror has two skills that grant it broad but inconsistent knowledge, allowing it to demonstrate insight into obscure subjects while remaining oblivious to more common knowledge.

## Spellcraft

The Hunting Horror has +26 Spellcraft, an unusually high skill for a creature of its type. While it uses this skill in ways any character with Spellcraft would—such as identifying spells—the remarkable part is that it possesses this level of magical expertise at all.

### Arcane vs. Divine Spells

> WOW! I didn't know Xykon knew how to cast cleric spells, too!

This moment demonstrates Spellcraft being used to distinguish between arcane and divine magic, a standard function of the skill. The Hunting Horror’s high proficiency means it can perform these identifications with ease.

### Half Ritual

> Fine! Read your stupid half of a ritual, I'll find someone else to help me!

This reference highlights the role of Spellcraft in understanding shared or incomplete magical workings, reinforcing how the skill enables spellcasters to interpret rituals even when only part of the information is available.

## Knowledge (Occult)

The Hunting Horror has +26 Knowledge (Occult) on its skill list, making it an ultimate wildcard for integrating mysterious lore into the story as needed. The official conversion rules state that skills unique to *Call of Cthulhu*—including Knowledge (Occult)—are unsuitable for *Dungeons & Dragons*. However, they also dismiss the need to update monsters, focusing instead on sanity mechanics and the altered spell system. This contradiction allows Rich creative freedom to define what Knowledge (Occult) covers, enabling the Monster in the Dark to demonstrate extensive knowledge of obscure topics while remaining unaware of things that are common knowledge to other characters.

Knowledge (Occult) has an unusual relationship with the setting. *Call of Cthulhu* takes place on Earth, where its skills typically apply to real-world concepts. However, Rich appears to have kept the skill names and their general intent while redefining the knowledge they cover to fit the *Order of the Stick* setting.

### Magical Books

> Oooo! Is it one of those books that raises your ability scores?
> Please! In the grand scheme of things, this book makes the "Tome of Clear Thought" look like "Dianetics".

Knowledge (Occult) explicitly covers magical books—your character's familiarity with texts like the Necronomicon is tied to it, for example. "Tome" is also the term *Call of Cthulhu* uses to describe magical books in general. Rich's choice of the word "tome" might be intentional, but if not, it’s still a striking coincidence given the thematic overlap.

### The Astral Plane

[Comic 833](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0833.html)

> Oooo! I love the Astral Plane! It's so silvery and weightless!

This implies that Rich has chosen to include Knowledge (The Planes) as a subset of Knowledge (Occult). This connection is particularly fitting, as the Astral Plane has real-world philosophical and esoteric counterparts that are discussed in various mystical and occult traditions.

### (Not) Recognizing Undead

Comic 431

Redcloak stresses that the three false Xykons are hard to distinguish, hence they each get a color-coded amulet. However, even after Redcloak explains that one is a huecuva, the Monster in the Dark is still surprised that "Xykon" can cast divine spells.

The simplest explanation is that Knowledge (Occult) explicitly excludes Knowledge (Religion). In *Call of Cthulhu*, Knowledge (Religion) pertains to real-world faiths, while in *Dungeons & Dragons*, it covers divine magic and undead. Because the names are the same, Rich likely retained the mechanical framework while redefining what the skill covers, adapting it naturally to the *Order of the Stick* setting.

Since Knowledge (Religion) is the skill used to identify undead, this would explain why the Monster in the Dark has no idea what a huecuva is or what it can do, despite its otherwise broad knowledge.

### Trenchant Political Analysis

[Comic 1038](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots1038.html)

> [Bugbears] mostly get name-dropped to bolster an appealing but ultimately specious pan-goblinoid narrative that probably arose to elide historic sectarian divisions between goblins and hobgoblins... is a thing I totally overheard some guy say.

I have a possible explanation for this, though I’m not fully convinced by it. If the story concludes without further clarification, I may present this more assertively as one of the best remaining interpretations. My preferred solution is that the Monster in the Dark really is repeating something it overheard, exactly as it claims, but without knowing who that person is or what their expertise might be, I prefer to lean on an unlikely explanation that still aligns with established mechanics.

First, it's important to note that the rules for recognizing monsters do not exist in d20 Call of Cthulhu. The DM is never compelled to tell you what a monster is or how it works. However, the *Detect Life* spell offers an alternative:

> You detect living creatures. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
>
> At the GM's discretion, understanding what a creature is and what it can do may require a Cthulhu Mythos, Knowledge (Occult), or Knowledge (Biology) check.

*d20 Call of Cthulhu* is not the best-organized book, and niche rules like this are scattered throughout, affecting many skills.

Rich probably decided he wanted a *Call of Cthulhu* spell in the story first, read the full spell list, and selected *Word of Recall* as one that could be framed as strange and mysterious when altered. In this scenario, the *Escape* scene would have been written around this choice. &#x20;

While reviewing the spell list, Rich would have also encountered *Detect Life* along the way.

The three relevant skills are Knowledge (Biology), Knowledge (Occult), and Cthulhu Mythos. If goblins fall under Knowledge (Occult), then the Monster in the Dark could reasonably know something this detailed.

Cthulhu Mythos is a pseudo-skill that can only be learned by encountering Mythos creatures, which doesn’t fit *Order of the Stick*—goblins are not unknowable horrors. Even if someone argued that it does fit, a monster like the Hunting Horror automatically passes all Cthulhu Mythos checks, as the rules explicitly state that such creatures treat the unfathomable as normal.

Biology is a plausible alternative, given that goblins are close enough to humans that some crossover might apply. If Rich chose to adjust the skill to fit his setting in this way, this could provide a reasonable explanation.

However, goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears all "exist" in real-world folklore, and studying them would plausibly fit under Knowledge (Occult), which explicitly covers ancient mysteries, magical traditions, and cryptozoology. If Rich approached this similarly to Knowledge (Religion)—keeping the name "goblin" while adjusting its scope to suit the setting—then Knowledge (Occult) could reasonably explain the Monster in the Dark's familiarity with goblinoids in this scene.

Ultimately, we are making educated guesses about how Rich adapted existing mechanics in a way that best suited the story, given that those mechanics sometimes contradict each other. With more evidence, certain interpretations might become stronger, but in the absence of that, readers can weigh the contradictions and decide for themselves what they find most convincing.
