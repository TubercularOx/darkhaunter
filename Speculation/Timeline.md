# Timeline

### Strip #15

- First appearance of Eugene
- Foreshadows Strip #59, but it's not clear how much of in between was planned. [Foreshadowing]

### Strip #43

- First appearance of the Linear Guild
- Nale was planned as a recurring adversary at this time [Nale plans]

### Strip #53

- First appearance of Celia - Celia was designed as a one-shot gag [Celia plans]
- Being turned to stone prepares her to be cured later, so she can remove Nale and Thog from the dungeon
- Alleged: One-shot Celia never made it out of planning, her first appearance sets up her later appearances.
- Otherwise: Rich got lucky at having a character ready and not having to introduce some other plot.

### Strip #59

- Fulfills the foreshadowing of #15, but that foreshadowing does not imply all the intervening strips were fully planned.

### Strip #62

- Sabine flees, but promises to return.
- How does this relate to the plans for her that Rich mentions in [Nale plans]?

### Strip #66

- Thog surrenders
- How does this relate chronologically to Rich's decision to upgrade Thog from dead to recurring character? [Nale plans]

### Strip #72

- Durkon confirmed separated from party
- Last possible strip to be on time for defeating Xykon at strip #100 [Xykon plans]
- Nale and Thog set up to return after the end of the current dungeon [Celia plans]

### Strip #92

- First dialog of Goblin teenagers
- Last possible strip to be on time for reaching Xykon's throne room at strip #100 [Xykon plans]

### Strip #93

- First appearance of the Goblin teenagers (but see Strip #92)
- Rich says he first considered moving beyond the dungeon. [Dungeon exit]

### Strip #96

- First appearance of the gates
- First appearance of the "What Gate?" joke
- Alleged: First appearance of the Hunting Horror

### Strip #100

- Around this strip, the Monster in the Dark's base monster was confirmed. (But see Strip #96)
- First target for defeating Xykon - delayed by Durkon's subplot
- Second target for entering Xykon's throne room - delayed by Goblin teenagers

### Strip #120

- Sabine officially returns. [Nale plans]
- This is after Strip #93, and therefore it's possible the plans Rich refers to are her related to her connection to the IFCC.  OTOH, see Strip #62

[Xykon plans] Dungeon Crawlin' Fools, page 118

My original plans called for the Order to defeat Xykon in strip #100, but the addition of the Durkon story pushed that back. Then I intended for them to enter Xykon’s throne room in #100, but the inclusion of the goblin teenagers delayed it further.

In the end, I decided that all the expectations would be for a giant celebratory strip; after all, that’s what I had done for #50, right? And by now, you should realize that I hate fulfilling people’s expectations, so #100 was nothing special—so much so that even Haley was disappointed.

**Q:** *When you began the strip, did you have any intention of the Order ever leaving the Dungeon of Dorukan to have adventures elsewhere and at what point did you make the decision that the comic would have a long complicated story rather than being just a gag-a-day strip for D&D fans?*

**A:** No, even once I decided that the strip would follow the same characters every installment—my first plan called for the comic to be an anthology of gags using a different party each time—I still thought that they would simply wander the dungeon forever. It wasn't until around #93 that I started thinking about wrapping up the dungeon and moving on. I wish I could say what, exactly, made me change my mind but I don't remember. I know that I thought I was leaving a lot of good jokes on the table by never having them go to town or on a wilderness adventure, though.

[Celia plans] Dungeon Crawlin' Fools, page 70

Celia the Sylph began as a one-shot joke but turned into the perfect way to remove Nale and Thog from the dungeon. After all, if the Order left them there, I would need to show them coming back for revenge before the end of the current dungeon, and honestly, I didn’t want a repeat appearance so soon.

[Nale plans] Dungeon Crawlin' Fools, page 68

I had originally planned for all of the Guild to be permanently wiped out except for Nale (who I always intended as a recurring adversary). I soon realized that Thog was not only the perfect sidekick for Nale’s nefarious plotting, he was beloved by fans.  I also devised new story plans for Sabine (plans which have yet to come to fruition, I might add), so the Linear Guild was merely dispersed rather than executed. Well, except for poor Yikyik.

*[Rich is imprecise about when he devised the plans for Sabine.  He makes it sound like it was at the same time as he decided Thog got to live, but he may have been hiding spoilers about when the story expanded]*

[Foreshadowing] Dungeon Crawlin' Fools, page 20

Then strip #15 initiates the subplot concerning Roy’s father and the mysterious omen about goats. At that time, I already had conceived of the Linear Guild (as seen in Round 3) and knew that the prophecy referred to Elan’s as-yet-unnamed evil twin.

The details came later, naturally, but I had enough of an idea in my head to lead the story in that direction.
