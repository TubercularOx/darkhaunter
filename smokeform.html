        <h2 id="main_heading">A Hunting Horror’s Layered Defenses</h2>
        <div id="main_content">
            <p>A Hunting Horror’s layered defenses make it tough for Miko to land meaningful hits. Key abilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Smoke Form:</strong> Grants incorporeality, which includes a +5 AC bonus (from Cha), and a 50% chance to ignore damage, even when hit with magic weapons. This uses the Monster Manual III rules, which were intended to supersede the original rules. Rich has a design credit in Monster Manual III, likely familiarizing him with the updated rules for incorporeal creatures. This makes their use here reasonable.<br>
                    In its smoke form, attacks could harmlessly swirl through the Hunting Horror, fitting the Monster in the Dark’s laughter and claim that it tickles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Deflect Harm:</strong> Negates any hit at the cost of 2 Int damage. If used, it overrides Smoke Form’s ability to ignore damage, but lets the Hunting Horror keep the +5 AC bonus. While Deflect Harm’s requirements for activation and concentration make it less fitting for the Monster in the Dark’s portrayal, it remains a plausible alternative and is included for consideration.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Defense Breakdown</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>50% miss chance</strong> from being concealed in darkness.</li>
                <li><strong>AC 26:</strong> 10 +9 natural, +5 deflection, +3 Dex, -1 Large size</li>
                <li><strong>50% chance to ignore damage</strong> when hit, from being in an incorporeal smoke form.</li>
                <li><strong>Fast Healing 10:</strong> Renders the first 10 points of damage each round moot.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Likely Outcomes</h3>
            <p>Based on <a href="#">reasonable assumptions and AI-generated math</a>, we can calculate Miko’s odds of overcoming these defenses and causing damage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>80% chance</strong> Miko does no damage in any given round.</li>
                <li><strong>10% chance</strong> she deals 5 or less damage after fast healing.</li>
                <li><strong>10% chance</strong> she does 6 or more damage after fast healing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Furthermore, Miko is unlikely to be able to keep up with Fast Healing 10 when most of her shots do 0 damage. Rich’s portrayal of the Monster laughing and saying, "It tickles," matches Miko’s attacks often doing no damage and rare hits being quickly healed.</p>
