# If You Listen, You Can Hear Rich Laughing

This page is subjective. Sometimes, Rich pulls off something so perfectly absurd that I can’t help but imagine him laughing right along with me. Your mileage may vary, but I know what I hear.

## What Gate?

Gates figure prominently in *Call of Cthulhu*. There are spells to create them, find them, look through them safely, protect them, and bar their use. The refrain for describing gates is, "a circle or pattern on a floor (or other horizontal surface) that teleports any willing creature standing on it." This or some variation shows up several times throughout the rules.

Given how gates are described, it follows that a Hunting Horror wouldn’t immediately recognize any of the ones placed before the Monster in the Dark. None of the gates encountered are circles or patterns on the ground, at least until the reveal near the end of the story.

I suspect Rich lucked into this gag—he probably told the first gate joke without yet knowing what the Monster in the Dark really was. He must've been thrilled when he realized the cosmic-scale stunt he could pull.

## A Flawless Mystery

Twice, Rich presents the Monster in the Dark as nigh-invulnerable: once in [Comic 374](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0374.html), when Miko fails to affect it, and again in [Comic 477](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0477.html), when Belkar fails to affect it. At first glance, this seems to suggest the Monster in the Dark has a single, all-encompassing defense. But that assumption may be incorrect.

The **Hunting Horror’s defensive abilities** include **Smoke Form**—which lets it become incorporeal—and **Deflect Harm**, which allows it to negate attacks. These are two separate defenses, each with a limitation: Smoke Form means it can’t interact with objects, and Deflect Harm requires concentration.

Neither ability alone explains both encounters. In [Comic 374](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0374.html), the Monster in the Dark laughs uncontrollably, which strongly suggests it isn’t concentrating—making it unlikely that Deflect Harm is in play. In [Comic 477](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0477.html), it holds its umbrella, which suggests it isn’t incorporeal—making Smoke Form unlikely.

The trick here may lie in a classic stage magician’s technique: **create the same effect multiple times but use a different method each time**. By showcasing two different abilities in two different fights, Rich encourages the audience to search for a single, universal defense—one that doesn’t require concentration and isn’t incorporeality. That assumption, however, may be misleading.

If this is correct, then Rich is playing with audience expectations in a way that feels deliberately mischievous—hence, I imagine him laughing. I can't imagine trying to piece this together without first confirming that the Monster in the Dark is a Hunting Horror. That confirmation allows the audience to reexamine past events with new information, revealing details that weren’t obvious before. The reveal doesn’t hand out all the answers—it invites further discovery.

### Miko vs. The Smoke Form Hunting Horror

Smoke Form grants incorporeality, but more importantly, it creates a mental image of Miko's swords passing through a cloud of smoke, swirling it in a way that could create a tickling sensation. This doesn’t necessarily mean the attack is harmless—even when Miko is dealing damage, her sword is still interacting with the smoke, with the magic of the blade allowing her to land hits at the same time. It’s also worth noting that tickling isn’t always painless, even in the real world.

The math behind this depends on many factors: Miko's levels, her attributes, and her magic items are all important unknowns. The Hunting Horror may also gain significant defensive benefits from taking the Total Defense action, if a reflexive reaction to being tickled can be interpreted that way.&#x20;

In many plausible scenarios, Miko’s damage output would be less than 10 hp per round, meaning it could be completely negated by the Hunting Horror’s Fast Healing 10. If that’s the case, Miko could swing indefinitely and still never kill the Monster in the Dark.&#x20;

Rich is then free to summarize this inevitable outcome in a single round that has no visible effect.

### Belkar vs. The Harm Deflecting Hunting Horror

Deflect Harm is a spell unique to Call of Cthulhu that the Hunting Horror has as an at-will Spell-Like Ability, which removes it from the dramatic limitations associated with casting a Call of Cthulhu spell directly:

> You deflect a number of successful incoming physical attacks equal to your level, although each attack you deflect causes you to take 2 points of temporary Intelligence damage. All attacks deflected must occur before your next action.

While the spell only lasts for an action, it does require Concentration during that action to use it. In this scene, we see the Monster in the Dark sorting out its thoughts. Rich often presents concentration subtly rather than explicitly, and based on how it is handled in other instances, it is reasonable to infer that a creature visibly engaged in thought could also be maintaining an invincible shield.

The 20% miss chance from darkness and a miss or two from its AC help limit the Intelligence damage it takes. Even in an unfavorable scenario, the Hunting Horror's 17 Intelligence is enough to absorb the maximum possible 10 damage and remain functional.

However, temporary Intelligence damage may still have lingering effects. Later in the same scene, the Monster in the Dark complains of being "really tired all of a sudden." Much later, in the Escape scene, the Monster in the Dark falls asleep after casting a spell that deals both Intelligence and Wisdom ability damage. Although it's not definitive, this pattern suggests that Rich may be using fatigue as a way to represent the effects of ability damage from *Call of Cthulhu* spells.

In Belkar’s scene, the Monster in the Dark seems completely indifferent to attacks—reinforced by the Demon Roach’s "0 for 5" remark and Haley’s assumption that it isn’t even noticing the strikes. This framing encourages the audience to assume the same flawless defense applies in Miko’s scene, making it less obvious that Miko was actually landing hits on the Monster in the Dark.&#x20;

It’s even possible that Miko’s attacks exceeded the Hunting Horror’s Fast Healing, but any signs of damage were masked by its laughter.  Tickling can override pain responses, even in real life, meaning the Monster in the Dark could have been taking significant damage without reacting in a way that would normally signal injury. This raises the possibility that Miko could have eventually defeated it, had it remained in place long enough—despite later impressions that it is invincible.
