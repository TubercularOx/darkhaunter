# If You Listen, You Can Hear Rich Laughing

Gates figure prominently in *Call of Cthulhu*. There are spells to create them, find them, look through them safely, protect them, and bar their use. The refrain for describing gates is, "a circle or pattern on a floor (or other horizontal surface) that teleports any willing creature standing on it." This or some variation shows up several times throughout the rules.

Given how gates are described, it follows that a Hunting Horror wouldn’t immediately recognize any of the ones placed before the Monster in the Dark. None of the gates encountered are circles or patterns on the ground, at least until the reveal near the end of the story.

I suspect Rich lucked into this gag—he probably told the first gate joke without yet knowing what the Monster in the Dark really was. He must've been thrilled when he realized the cosmic-scale stunt he could pull.

I named this page to leave room for other jokes, but if I find any, they’re all going to orbit this one like distant planets around a massive star.
