        <h2>Intertextual Moments</h2>
        <p>Rich created a number of intertextual moments for the Monster in the Dark: Scenes that stand on their own but gain additional meaning by referring to an external text, specifically the Monster in the Dark's D&D stats. Since this other text wasn't defined until the reveal, these moments are also a kind of prolepsis.</p>
        
        <p>These moments don’t function as traditional foreshadowing, as they don’t predict events in the story. Instead, they serve as subtle evidence that Rich always intended the Monster in the Dark to be a Hunting Horror, rewarding readers familiar with D&D mechanics while seamlessly fitting into the story for all audiences.</p>

        <h3>The Rope Scene</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p><em>"I'm a lot better at pushing than pulling. Pulling has all those tricky parts where you hold something and move it at the same time."</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>This line aligns with the Hunting Horror’s abilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"Better at pushing": Fist of Yog-Sothoth</strong>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><em>"You can pummel a foe with a magical blow. The force strikes like a big fist, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). The target is subjected to a bum's rush attack as if the fist had a Strength equal to the caster's Intelligence and was Large."</em></p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li><strong>"Tricky parts of pulling": Grasp of Cthulhu</strong>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><em>"Calling upon the name of Great Cthulhu, you summon magical energies that wrap around a subject, holding it motionless. Each round, the subject takes 2d6 points of subdual damage. The grasp can render targets unconscious but cannot kill."</em></p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The "Poor Mr. Stiffly" Scene</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p><em>"Poor Mr. Stiffly! I hoped really, really hard, and he still didn't escape. I don't know why it didn't work."</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>For readers not interested in D&D statistics, this moment highlights the Monster in the Dark's naive and childlike perspective. However, when viewed intertextually, it probably alludes to the Hunting Horror’s spell <em>Evil Eye</em>:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><em>"You focus magical energy through your gaze and curse someone with bad luck. [...] The subject suffers a -4 luck penalty to all attack rolls, checks, and saves."</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <h3>The "Stew You" Scene</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p><em>"Really? Didn't I read someplace that dwarves were like a delicacy for your kind?"</em></p>
            <p><em>"I don't... think so."</em></p>
            <p><em>"Huh. Maybe I'll just zombify them, then."</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>In <em>The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath</em>, ghouls live in communal underground kingdoms, much like dwarves in D&D. Hunting Horrors, as servants of Nyarlathotep, are sent to harass these ghouls. Xykon’s dialogue builds up a connection between dwarves, ghouls, Hunting Horrors, and the Monster in the Dark.</p>
