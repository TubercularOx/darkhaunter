# The Fine Line: How the Hunting Horror Doesn't Fit

## Introduction

The Monster in the Dark does not perfectly match the Hunting Horror. Rich made changes to its stats, sometimes to make it fit better, other times because it enabled the story. The fine line he refers to is the one he had to walk—keeping the Monster in the Dark recognizable as a Hunting Horror while ensuring it served the story in ways that sometimes diverged from its original form. This balancing act made it possible to figure out eventually, but only with careful observation.

## Theme and Appearance

As mentioned on the front page, Rich had to make changes to the Hunting Horror's theme and appearance. He was fortunate to be able to opt for a two-eyed version and demonstrated skill in converting Cosmic Horror into Comical Errors. The transformation of Nyarlathotep into the Snarl was a significant departure, testing the boundaries of adaptation while staying just within the fine line.

## Size Discrepancy

The Hunting Horror is Huge, and can grow all the way to Colossal, while the Monster in the Dark is Large. Rich resolved this by making the Hunting Horror a child, allowing it to fit within the established size constraints. While the Hunting Horror itself lacks age categories, it does have the Dragon type. Rich may have drawn inspiration from dragon progressions while consciously disregarding the lack of explicit age categories in the Hunting Horror’s stat block.

## Alignment

*Call of Cthulhu* monsters do not have a printed alignment, which may have given Rich greater flexibility in shaping the Monster in the Dark’s role in the story. Without a predefined moral framework, he could explore a more fluid characterization without contradicting established lore. This allowed him to tell a story about an evil monster becoming good—a theme that wouldn't have worked as well if the creature had a fixed alignment.

The *Call of Cthulhu* rulebook does contain an appendix with alignment conversions, but it is obscure enough that Rich may have already solidified his approach before ever encountering it.

## The Shock Wave Feat

The Hunting Horror is printed with the *Shot on the Run* feat, but it doesn’t qualify for it—it lacks the prerequisites. Even if it had those, its only ranged attack is a vomit ability, making the feat an odd choice.

However, the Hunting Horror does qualify for *Shock Wave* (Draconomicon, p. 73). Swapping out *Shot on the Run* for *Shock Wave* serves two purposes.

First, it enables the earthquake scene—the Monster in the Dark strikes the ground so hard with its tail that it knocks other creatures down and damages structures and unattended objects.

Second, people who accepted the *Shock Wave* interpretation would conclude that the Monster in the Dark is a Dragon, as *Shock Wave* requires the Dragon type. Likewise, those who started from the assumption that the Monster in the Dark was a Dragon would naturally be drawn to the *Shock Wave* feat as supporting evidence. Choosing a feat with such specific prerequisites not only reinforces the connection but also provides a two-way path for reasoning toward the same conclusion.

The thread identified *Shock Wave* early on as a strong possibility for the earthquake scene. However, later discussions moved away from this conclusion due to concerns that the way Rich depicted the scene was more exaggerated than the feat’s description implied.

## The Escape Spell

The Escape Scene is best understood as a *Call of Cthulhu* spell cast by the Monster in the Dark.&#x20;

### How Call of Cthulhu Spells Work

These spells follow a template system:

- They cannot share a name with their template spell.
- They must differ in one or two ways from their template spell.
- They always retain an aura of mystery and strangeness, never being easy, mechanical, mundane, or safe.

### Word of Recall → Escape

The spell in question is a variant of *Word of Recall*, renamed to *Escape*:

- Instead of requiring a chosen sanctuary at casting, it picks one automatically.
- It excludes the caster, either specifically or optionally.
- Aside from these changes, it functions the same way.

### Meeting the Requirements

Several details reinforce the connection between *Escape* and *Call of Cthulhu* magic:

- Its climactic use in Don’t Split the Party underscores the narrative weight that Call of Cthulhu magic always demands.
- The Monster in the Dark gambles everything—casting Escape with Xykon watching could have meant  death.  Call of Cthulhu magic is never safe and always a last resort.
- Teleportation effects in D&D do not typically function this way, making the spell feel strange and mysterious when it is finally used.

### Foreshadowing and Reinforcement

Rich provides a few clues to guide us toward the connection to *Call of Cthulhu* magic.

- Redcloak using *Word of Recall* earlier in the scene introduces the original spell before its variant appears.
- In a later scene, the Monster in the Dark fails to activate *Escape*, reinforcing the idea that *Call of Cthulhu* spells are unpredictable and not purely mechanical.
- When the Monster in the Dark attempts to recast *Escape*, it cycles through synonyms, subtly reinforcing the renaming conventions of *Call of Cthulhu* magic.

### The Fine Line and *Escape*

In hindsight, the *Escape* spell may have tested the fine line more than intended. It became a daunting shibboleth—an expectation that no candidate could meet without exceeding the boundaries of its own stat block.&#x20;

In the case of the Hunting Horror, *Escape* was a spell Rich had to construct within the template system's constraints. For the Monster in the Dark, learning it would require a standard method—either being taught by another or having it impressed upon its mind by a greater power. This additional complexity blurred the boundary between an organic part of the character and an external addition, making it harder to distinguish what was intrinsic to the Hunting Horror and what was imposed on the Monster in the Dark by the story's needs.
