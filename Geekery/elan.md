## Elan’s Level

In Strip X, **Elan** gains a level. He gains two new fifth-level spells and one new fourth-level spell, a progression that occurs **only at Bard 13**.

At that time, Elan plans to _eventually_ swap one of his existing spells for _Cure Critical Wounds_. Under the core Bard spell-swapping rules, the **first level a Bard may swap out a fourth-level spell is 17th**.

In Strip Y, Elan casts _Cure Critical Wounds_, with significant narrative emphasis placed on the **spell’s first on-panel use**.

Taken together, this indicates Elan is **at least 17th level** when Strip Y occurs.
