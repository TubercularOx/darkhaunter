# Durkon Allotrope Thundershield

## Interactive Voice Response

In [Strip 7](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0007.html), Durkon is offered some spells that are not on the main cleric spell list, namely Heathen Smiting, Heat Blisters of Eternal Pain, and (Colon) Tumor. Although presented as a joke, they are clear statements about spells available to Durkon.
