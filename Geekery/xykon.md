# Xykon

## Maximized Energy Drain

[Strip 652](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0652.html)

Energy Drain is a 9th level spell, Maximize requires a spell slot at least 3 levels higher.  There are multiple ways for Xykon to achieve this.

### Improved Spell Capacity x3

This gives Xykon a 12th level spell slot.  It requires he be at least 26th level so that he can have 3 epic feats.

### Improved Metamagic

This would reduce the cost of Maximize down to 2 or even 1 level higher, but not 0, so Xykon would still need at least a 10th level spell slot.  It requires at least rank 30 in spellcraft, so implies a level of at least 27th.

### Sudden Maximize

Once per day, Xykon could maximize a spell without increasing its spell level.  He doesn't need to decide in advance which spell or when to use it.

### Metamagic Rod of Maximize

The scene does not depict a rod being used, but people suggest it anyways.
