# Xykon

## Enhanced Metamagic

Energy Drain is a 9th level spell, Maximize requires a spell slot at least 3 levels higher.    Meteor Swarm is also a 9th level spell, and Still requires a spell slot at least 1 level higher.

There are multiple ways for Xykon to achieve this.

### Improved Spell Capacity x3

This feat, taken three times, gives Xykon a 12th level spell slot to use for Energy Drain, and implies a 10th level spell slot for Meteor Swarm.  It requires he be at least 27th level so that he can have 3 epic feats.

### Improved Metamagic

This feat would reduce the cost of Maximize down to 2 or even 1 level higher, but not 0, so Xykon would still need at least a 10th level spell slot.  It requires at least rank 30 in spellcraft, so also implies a level of at least 27th.

### Sudden Maximize or Sudden Still

With Sudden Maximize, once per day, Xykon could maximize a spell without increasing its spell level.  He doesn't need to decide in advance which spell or when to use it.  Likewise for Sudden Still.

## Reverse Psychology

In [Strip 106](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0652.html) Redcloak mentions Xykon having ranks in Reverse Psychology.  Although delivered as a joke, it is a clear statement about Xykon's skills.  We know less about it than most such jokes, since Xykon himself refers to making a Bluff check a few panels earlier.  Perhaps 5 ranks gives one a synergy bonus?
