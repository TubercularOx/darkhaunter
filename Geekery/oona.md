# Oona

## Ranger
The evidence suggests Oona is a Ranger. [Minrah](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots1219.html) and [Roy](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots1273.html) call her a Ranger.  She [dual wields](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots1213.html), and she [demonstrates](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots1216.html) tracking ability. Greyview presents as her animal companion, but see below.

## Beast Heart Adept
Greyview is [a warg](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots1273.html). A warg is not normally a valid Animal Companion, but Beast Heart Adepts are allowed wargs as a monstrous companion. Oona’s [yrthak mount](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots1033.html) is likewise a valid monstrous companion for Beast Heart Adepts of level 9 or 10. Beast Heart Adepts can have up to three such companions.

A prerequisite of becoming a Beast Heart Adept is spending a week living alone in a dungeon complex. Oona already lives in a dungeon complex; she would only need to find some time alone to qualify.
